# Privacy-preserving-AES-based-health-record
Cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) systems permit curative information to be transferred between hospitals; this is expected to contribute to improvisation of various healthcare services in the future. However, with increase in complications of the system architecture, the cloud based EMR systems allows for compromise of security features. The patients thus are under the risk of breach of security and leakage of confidential data.IN order to prevent this, methodologies like AES based access control to authorized entities have been proposed. However, most existing systems do not support AES based access control or considers extra privacy preserving cryptographic features. In this paper, we propose an AES based privacy preserving EHR model that performs attribute-based access control using Advanced Encryption Standard. Our EHR model, focused on security, performs partial encryption and uses electronic signatures when a patient document is sent to a document requester. We used AES encryption and decryption technique using 128 bit keys. Our proposed model works efficiently by sending only the necessary information to requesters who are authorized to treat the patient in question.
